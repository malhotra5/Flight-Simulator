# Flight-Simulator
A flight simulator made from scratch using the geometric power of processing.
## Getting Started
These instructions will help get the flight simulator up and running. 
### Prerequisites
Get the processing environment, an open-source graphical library. This code can be replicated to be  written in Python also. Although, I have done it in java. Visit this website for more information about the python environment - https://github.com/jdf/processing.py \
The environment looks this the following -

Be sure to set the programming language to which ever one you want. This can be done by looking at the top right corner.

## Tasks in progress 
I am working to replicate the work I have done into Python. Additional flight features such as the roll for the plane need to be added.
