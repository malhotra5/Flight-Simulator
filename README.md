# Flight-Simulator
A flight simulator made from scratch using the graphical capabilities of processing.
## Getting Started
These instructions will help get the flight simulator up and running. 
### Prerequisites
Get the processing environment, an open-source graphical library. This code can be replicated to be  written in Python also. I have done it in Java. Visit this website for more information about the python environment - https://github.com/jdf/processing.py \
The processing environment looks like the following -

Be sure to set the programming language to which ever one you want. This can be done by looking at the top right corner. Notice, the picture above says **"Java"** in the top right corner.

## How it works

### Making the landscape

### Moving the landscape

### Making graphics for plane's pitch

### Making graphics for plane's roll

### Detecting collision

### Adding color

## Built With
Java and Python. Evnvironment - Processing.

## Tasks in progress 
I am working to replicate the work I have done into Python. Additional flight features such as the roll for the plane need to be added.
